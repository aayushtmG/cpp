-Memory addresses are shown in hexadecimal format mainly because hexadecimal is more compact, readable, and aligned with how computers process and store data.
-0x is just prefix for the indication that its a hexadecimal number actual,address starts after it.
-Arrays are just pointer in c,c++ int A[5]; is basically a A named pointer pointing to the first element's memory address
-A[i] is basically *(A +i) A[i], so it will also work as *(i+A)i[A]
-  array is just  pointer and collection of memory address?
